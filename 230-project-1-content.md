# Shotgun
###### *Manually Reload and Fire a Shotgun at Incoming Zombies *

#### **Platform:** Web

##### **Categories:** Action, Simulation

Here you make your last stand. The zombie hordes have been chasing you for days, and you are tired of running. You pull out your trusty shotgun, crouch down and prepare to fire away at the incoming zombies. How long can you last? This is a dark and tense game where you fight against you own ineviatable death. The struggle is pointless, but you have to at least try, *right*?

The art style will be pixelated and cartoonish in the overworld view, to contrast with the realistic appearence of the shotgun during the reloading sequences. There will be no background music. Instead, there will be the sounds of the wind and crows around you. Reloading the gun will produce clicking and locking sounds, the zombies will move quietly, with muffled footsteps and the shotgun will produce a loud bang that completely overshadows all other sounds.

The gameplay is simple. There is no movement. The combat will take place in two views. The main view will have the player facing an incoming horde of enemies while aiming his shotgun. The player will then have to press the reload key, which will take him to the second view: a zoom in on the shotgun. There he will have to remove the empty shell from the gun, drag and drop a new shell into the corrent place and cock the gun. At that point the gun wil be ready to fire. The player can then press a button to take him back to the main screen where he will fire the gun at the incomig zombie. The game will loop like this untill the player is killed by the horde.
The mouse will be used for the reloading sequence, while the keys to change view and fire the gun will be on the keyboard. There will be a shotgun shell on screen that will be glowing to indicate to the player that he should click it. After figuring out that the reload sequence is a sort of point and click thing, the rest of the process should be intuitive and left for the player to figure out. On the minimalistic GUI there will be instructions to use the two keyboard buttons the game requires.

I will be using photoshop to create all the sprites and backgrounds, as well as the animations. The rest I will do with JavaScript.
