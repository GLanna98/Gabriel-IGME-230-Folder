Here you make your last stand. The zombie hordes have been chasing you for days, and you are tired of running. You pull out your trusty shotgun, crouch down and prepare to fire away at the incoming zombies. How long can you last? This is a dark and tense game where you fight against you own ineviatable death. The struggle is pointless, but you have to at least try, *right*?
